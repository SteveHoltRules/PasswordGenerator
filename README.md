# PasswordGenerator
Challenge 3 Password Generator

## Project Notes

The project was to create a password generator using Javascript that take inputs from the user and display an output based on the selected criteria. To accomplish this, I create a an index that adds values, selected at random, to the password array. The arrays used are determined by the user through the use of prompts. Currently there is an error when the user selects cancel on the prompt to select the characters. A future improvement will correct this error. An additonal improvement in the future will be to clear the password when the generate password button is pressed a second time.
